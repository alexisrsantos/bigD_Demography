# Description
This is a repository that includes code and information required to perform text analysis of JSTOR metadata from the Demography Journal.
Every demographer learns that there are three **demographic processess**: 

* Fertility - people are born (and give birth)
* Migration - people move
* Mortality - people die

Demography is now studied through different perspectives including: economics, geography, political sciences, human development, sociology, anthropology, and many other disciplines. Despite the growth and expansion of demography as a discipline, it remains unclear how frequent we are studying these three demographic processess and whether any trend has emerged regarding the study of them. 

Recently, those who study one of the three demographic processess are informally granted the "Big D Demographer" badge of honor. This informal badge of honor may be worthy of attention if we identify patterns of decline in the publication of articles that study these processess.
